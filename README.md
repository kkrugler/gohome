## The Game

You play against the computer, in a modified version of Go Fish. 
Each of you are dealt seven cards, with three more cards dealt 
face-up in the middle, and the remaining cards face down in a 
stack that's next to the three face-up cards. In addition, each
player is dealt a random "persona" card, which matches one of
the seven available personalities. The persona card is only
visible to the player.

Players take turns. Each turn involves either picking from the
three face-up cards, or the deck, or attempting to steal cards
from the other player that match a card already in your hand.

A complete set is 2, 3 or 4 cards of the same item. Each item
has the number of cards in its set printed at the top-left
corner of the card. Whenever a set is completed, it is automatically
removed from the player's hand and placed face-up to the right of
the player's hand.

The game is over when no more cards are available for drawing.
At that time each player's completed sets are scored, and the player
with the higher score wins.

A set's score is equal to the number of cards in the set (2, 3, or 4).
If the items in a set is associated with the player's persona (based
on color, and the hopefully obvious connection with that persona) then
the score for that set is doubled.
